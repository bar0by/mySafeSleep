# mySafeSleep
SafeSleep implementation for Hackintosh 10.10 - 10.12

Use [Power Manager](https://www.dssw.co.uk/powermanager/) to schedule these scripts at sleep, wake and critical battery level(optional).

To use this, create a new directory called "Projects" in your HOME and clone this repo there.
